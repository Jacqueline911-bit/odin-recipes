        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornstarch, and
            sesame oil to make the marinade. Add the sliced beef to the
            marinade, making sure it's evenly coated. <br />Let it marinate for
            at least 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or a large skillet
            over high heat. <br />Once the oil is hot, add the marinated beef
            and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until it's browned. <br />Remove the
            beef from the wok and set it aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same wok, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil and saut√©
            the minced garlic and grated ginger until fragrant, for about 30
            seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the sliced red and green bell peppers, onion, and broccoli to
            the wok. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are slightly
            tender but still crisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, mix the hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, and honey to
            create the sauce. Pour the sauce over the vegetables in the wok and
            stir to coat them evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return the cooked beef to the wok and toss everything together,
            allowing the flavors to meld for another minute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the beef stir-fry to a serving platter. Garnish with sliced
            green onions and sprinkle sesame seeds on top for an extra touch of
            flavor and presentation.
          </li>
          <p>
            Serve the beef stir-fry hot with steamed rice or noodles for a
            delightful and satisfying meal.
