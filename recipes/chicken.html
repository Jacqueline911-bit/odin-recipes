        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
          <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (Italian-style if available)</li>
          <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>1 cup marinara sauce</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with
            parchment paper or lightly grease it with olive oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trim any excess fat from the chicken breasts and pound them to an
            even thickness (about 1/2 inch) with a meat mallet or the back of a
            heavy skillet. <br />Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper
            on both sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            In three separate shallow dishes, set up a breading station. In the
            first dish, add the all-purpose flour. In the second dish, beat the
            eggs. <br />In the third dish, combine the breadcrumbs, grated
            Parmesan cheese, dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, and a
            pinch of salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess.
            Then dip the chicken into the beaten eggs, ensuring it's fully
            coated. <br />Finally, press the chicken into the breadcrumb
            mixture, pressing down gently to adhere the breadcrumbs to the
            chicken. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the
            oil is hot, add the breaded chicken breasts and cook for about 3-4
            minutes per side or until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and the
            chicken is cooked through. <br />You may need to do this in batches
            if your skillet is not large enough to fit all the chicken at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the cooked chicken breasts to the prepared baking sheet.
            Spoon a generous amount of marinara sauce over each chicken breast,
            spreading it evenly. <br />Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over
            the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about
            10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the Chicken Parmesan from the oven and let it rest for a few
            minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.
          </li>
          <p>
            Serve the Chicken Parmesan over cooked spaghetti or with a side of
            garlic bread for a delightful and satisfying Italian-inspired meal!
            Enjoy!
