        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin
            sauce (if using), rice vinegar, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Set the
            sauce aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high
            heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and saut√© for about 1
            minute until fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the sliced red and yellow bell peppers, broccoli florets,
            carrot, sugar snap peas or snow peas, sliced mushrooms, and cabbage
            to the skillet. <br />Stir-fry the vegetables for about 3-4 minutes
            or until they are slightly tender but still crisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the prepared sauce over the vegetables in the skillet. Toss
            everything together to coat the vegetables evenly with the sauce.
            <br />Continue cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes until the sauce
            thickens and coats the vegetables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season the stir-fry with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the
            seasoning according to your preference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the skillet from the heat. The Vegetable Stir-Fry is now
            ready to be served.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the Vegetable Stir-Fry over cooked rice or noodles. Garnish
            with sesame seeds and sliced green onions for an extra touch of
            flavor and presentation.
